## Data

The dataset (education.csv) contains information on:
- Internet access percentages
- Device access percentages
- Dropout rates
- Segmentation by state, region (urban/rural), gender, and year

**Note:** The dataset used in this project is fictional and created for demonstration purposes. It does not originate from external organizations like ASER, NSO, MHRD, UNICEF, or UNESCO.

## Visualizations

1. **Internet Access by State**  
   - Bar chart showing internet access percentages by state and region.

2. **Dropout Rates by State**  
   - Bar chart displaying dropout rates by state and gender.

3. **Correlation Analysis**  
   - Scatter plot analyzing the relationship between internet access and dropout rates, with a regression trendline.

4. **State-Level Highlights**  
   - Cards highlighting states with the highest and lowest internet access and dropout rates.

5. **Time Series (Optional)**  
   - Line chart showing device access trends over time (if time data is available).

## Insights

- **Urban-Rural Divide:** Urban areas consistently show higher internet and device access compared to rural areas.
- **Gender Gap:** In rural areas, males tend to have higher internet access than females.
- **Regional Variations:** Southern states generally show more equitable access across genders.
- **Policy Implications:** States with high urban-rural divides or low digital access would benefit from targeted infrastructure investments and digital inclusion programs.
